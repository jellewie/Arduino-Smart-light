# WIP
This project is working, but still WIP.
I am trying to get all files together, so where might be things or descriptions missing.

# PCB is on EasyEDA
https://easyeda.com/jellewietsma/smart-light

# 3D model will be on thingiverse



# Smart light
A smart 3D printed light bulb, its a 15Watt smart light that includes for example; wifi and manual control, Clock mode, and multiple animations.

# What you need
[The hardware like for example the ESP32](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json)
[Arduino-WiFiManager](https://github.com/jellewie/Arduino-WiFiManager) (Although a version is already included)
[Arduino-Button](https://github.com/jellewie/Arduino-Button) (Although a version is already included in WIP version)
[Arduino-Stable-analog-read](https://github.com/jellewie/Arduino-Stable-analog-read) (Although a version is already included in WIP version)

# How it works
No step guide has been written yet, just as a quick hint; make sure to upload the sketch to ESP before embedding it in.
And there are some notes in the Schematic
